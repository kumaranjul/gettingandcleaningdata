**Steps Followed:**
1. Complete trained data was formed by column wise binding predictor variables(X), target variable(Y) & corresponding subjects
2. Similar activity was performed for test data
3. Feature names were imported features.txt file and assigned as column names for dataframe after removing any special charcacter from the strings denoting feature names
4. Test and train data were combined to form combined dataframe named 'dataset'
5. Group wise mean were calculated for each column and stored in the dataframe called 'summary' 

Note: All the varibles are based on intuition and ease of analysis. Further information for any feature can be looked from features_info.txt in the original dataset.
t: time domain feature
f: frequency domain feature
X,Y,Z: in the end of column names represent directions
